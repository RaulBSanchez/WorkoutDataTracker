# WorkoutDataTracker
This is a personal project to keep track of all my bike rides/runs. I have to upgrade the GUI in the future as Tkinter is giving me a bit of trouble. 

On the backend  I have a mysql database. I'll need to bring in all my previous workouts. I exported all the data from my apple workouts but it's a pretty big file so I'll need to take the time to comb through it.
